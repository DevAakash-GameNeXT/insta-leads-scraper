Stop the madness. Your Instagram is a dead zone. Our AI scans Google + Insta for your ideal clients,
auto-sends cold DMs that 48% actually open. No fluff. Just leads. Reply 'YES' and I'll pull 7
leads within a week. Or brother just keep with your calculator and no leads.'''

t2 = '''Wake up, {name}. {posts} posts â†’ {followers} followers = {ratio:.1f} leads/post. Brutal math.
I think you are suffering with low or even no leads conversion for your business. 
My AI crawls Google + Insta, researches 200+ leads/day, and fires DMs so sharp that 48% beg to reply.
You? You're stuck with hashtags and prayers.
Reply 'YES' and I'll hand-deliver 7 agency leads in 7 days.
Or keep chasing your {ratio:.1f} leads/post like a circus monkey. ðŸ”¥'''

t3 = '''Wake up, {name}. {posts} posts â†’ {followers} followers.
Your Instagram is just a diary, not a lead machine.
My AI hunts 200+ real agency leads daily on Google/Insta, researches them, and blasts cold DMs that
48% actually open. You? You're still typing 'Hey dear' like an unpaid intern.
Reply 'YES' and I'll dump 7 hot leads in your inbox this week. Or keep pretending
you love wasting 6 hours/day. ðŸš€'''
